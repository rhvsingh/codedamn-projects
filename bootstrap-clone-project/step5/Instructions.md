Step 5:

	In this step, We will be going to work on the social section.
	Firstly give an id to this section.
	And create another div inside of the content section as you did in the previous step in the content section
	Now inside the div, create an unordered list(ul) and there are 3 list items you have to add.
	Now here you have to use font awesome icons for social media icons.
	
	For example: 
		
		<div id="socials">
			<div>
				<ul>
					<li><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></li>
					<li><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></li>
					<li><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
