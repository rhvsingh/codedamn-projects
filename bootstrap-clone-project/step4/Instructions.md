Step 4:

	In this step, We will be going to work on the content section of the webpage.
	Firstly give an id to this section.
	And create another div inside of the content section.
	Now inside the div
		It actually contains 3 parts -
			1. For Heading
			2. Paragraph
			3. Input field and a button.
			
	For example: 
	
		<div id="content">
			<div>
				<h1>Our Website is Coming Soon</h1>
				<p>We're working hard to finish the development of this site. Sign up below to receive updates and to be notified when we launch!</p>
				<div id="form-fields">
					<input type="email" placeholder="Enter email address..."> <button type="submit">Notify Me!</button>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
